# Development Story for Hypgo Version 0.1
## Purpose of Version 0.1
### A Journey of Exploration and Learning with GitHub

Version 0.1 of hypgo marks the initial step in both developing the framework and familiarizing myself with GitHub workflows. As a developer who has primarily relied on external libraries, I had little prior experience with managing my own GitHub repository. This release represents not only the creation of a functional Go-based web framework but also a personal learning journey in mastering GitHub operations, such as version control, tagging, and repository management.

### Challenges and Learning Through AI-Assisted Development

To be transparent, the development process leveraged AI tools to accelerate progress. However, AI-generated code often introduced issues, requiring significant debugging and refinement. This process was itself a valuable learning experience, especially given my two years of Go programming experience. While I’ve gained a solid foundation, there’s still much to learn about Go’s ecosystem, dependency management, and best practices.

### Call for Community Feedback

I warmly welcome feedback and suggestions from the community. If you’re a seasoned developer who happens to come across this project, I’d greatly appreciate your insights and guidance to help improve hypgo and make it more robust.

### Future Plans: Wiki and Discussions

I’m currently exploring the possibility of enabling the Wiki and Discussions features on the GitHub repository. These could serve as platforms for documentation and community engagement, but I’m still weighing their implementation. Stay tuned for updates in future releases!
